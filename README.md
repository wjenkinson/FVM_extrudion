# 2D Extrusion Flow Solver

A Streamlit-based interface for simulating 2D viscous fluid flow in extrusion processes.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501)

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `roadmap.txt`: Development plan and progress tracking

## Current Status

- Phase 1: Basic Streamlit skeleton application (Complete)
- Phase 2: Implementation of parameter sliders (In Progress)
